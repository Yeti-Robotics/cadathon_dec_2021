We were going to use this a little bit to visualize + determine some values to use for shooting in autonomous but didn't. 

So this is unfinished and not all that great but I felt like including it anyway? To show what we tried or something...

You'll need to install tkinter (pip install tk) if you feel like running it. 

You can move the robot with the arrow keys, lock a trajectory with mouse1, and change velocity with the scroll wheel. 

The two lines shown are the borders between goalie/color and white zone/color.
